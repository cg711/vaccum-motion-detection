## Description
The Vaccum Motion Detector is a Python application that detects the movement of a robot vaccum around a small enclosed space. Video is inputted via the python shell and is then written upon to create the result you see above. OpenCV is utilized to recognize the robot via the yellow object on top of the robot and then contours are used to find the central point of the robots position for which a circle is drawn around.
